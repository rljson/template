✅ Quick open files by pressing `Cmd+Shift+P`, entering fragments of the
file name and pressing `enter`.

### Multi cursor search and replace

❌ Don't use `Cmd+F` to search and replace files

✅ Double click a word to be searched and replaced

Press `Ctrl+ddd...` to create a multi cursor on all occurrences of the word

Modify the word

Press `ESC` to finish multi cursor edit
