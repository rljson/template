## Install VS Code extensions

2. Press `Cmd+Shift+P`.
3. Type `Extensions: Show Recommended Extensions` and press `Enter`.

5. Make sure all recommended extensions are installed.

## Uninstall all test extensions (e.g., Jest or Jasmine)

Jest or Jasmine extensions conflict with the `Vitest` extension used in this
project.

Uninstall them if they are installed.

5. Press `Alt` and click the play button next to the test.

Execution should stop at the breakpoint.

## Update goldens

In various tests, we create golden files, which serve as reference files that
are compared against test-generated files.

If a change is detected, the test fails.

To update the golden files, run:

```bash
pnpm run updateGoldens
```

Then, check the changes in the `test/goldens` folder.
